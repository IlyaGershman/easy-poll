# Example - React

this is a project set up to show how to use easy-poll in a react project.
Idea is to show how to create pollings without using any state management library and not needed hooks.

## How to run

to start make sure you have node version >=18.

run `yarn` to install dependencies.

then `yarn dev` to start the dev server.

one started you can go to `http://localhost:5173/` to see the example.

## Note

Imports look straight to the `../../src` folder. In a real project, you would need to import from `@ilyagershman/easy-poll` instead.
